Content Based Image Retrieval
=====
Content-based image retrieval, also known as query by image content (QBIC), is the application of computer vision techniques to the image retrieval problem, that is, the problem of searching for digital images in large databases. 

Content-based image retrieval is opposed to traditional concept-based approaches. "Content-based" means that the search analyzes the contents of the image rather than the metadata such as keywords, tags, or descriptions associated with the image. The term "content" in this context might refer to colors, shapes, textures, or any other information that can be derived from the image itself.
